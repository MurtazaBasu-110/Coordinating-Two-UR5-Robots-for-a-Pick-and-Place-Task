# Coordinating-Two-UR5-Robots-for-a-Pick-and-Place-Task
Two UR5 Robots are coordinated where the master robot gets the object by detecting using a camera sensor and grasping it 
using a gripper. The master robot then goes near to the slave robot so that it can detect the object in its gripper. The
slave robot then gets te object from the master and places it at the destination position.
